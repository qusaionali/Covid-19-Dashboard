# voila-covid-19-dashboard
With the world coming to a standstill, thousands losing their lives and economies under free fall. The outbreak of COVID-19 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has highjacked the entire planet right now.
Under the lockdown, I decided to go through a few data repositories and started wrangling and plotting data. After a while, I decided to create a dashboard out of my jupyter notebook. The Steps I followed are:

0. Gather data from reliable and updating sources
1. Clean and prepare the data.
2. Visualize N number(using ipywidgets) of worst-hit countries using Plotly scatter plot.
3. Plot confirmed and death cases for the requested country.
4. Plot all cases on the world map using Folium

Then I converted the Notebook into a material theme-based Voila dashboard.

I gathered my data from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Data repository by John Hopkins CSSE.
